#' @title DAEDALUS system of ODEs
#' @description A compartmental epidemiological model with four age groups. This
#' function is intended to be passed to the solvers from the \pkg{deSolve}
#' package. This is a work in progress and additional components will be added
#' in future.
#' @param t A single double value for the time.
#' @param state Vector of the initial state. The form of the vector should be
#' \eqn{X_i, for X \in S, E, I_s, I_a, R, H, D}, where values for each
#' of the compartments for each age group \eqn{i} are given consecutively.
#' May be a matrix to allow for multiple age groups. See [daedalus()] for an
#' explanation of the epidemiological compartments.
#' @param parameters List for the parameters used in the simulation. See
#' [default_parameters()] for a list of parameters used in the user-facing model
#' function [daedalus()].
#' @return A list with a single numeric vector of the same size as `state`,
#' suitable as output for \pkg{deSolve} functions such as [deSolve::lsoda()].

#' # Details: DAEDALUS model
#'
#' This section is a work in progress, and describes the DAEDALUS model in
#' brief.
#'
#' The model is age-stratified, supports heterogeneity in social contacts
#' between age groups, and currently supports four age groups.
#'
#' ## Epidemiological model
#'
#' The model has the following epidemiological compartments: susceptible
#' (\eqn{S}), exposed (\eqn{E}), infectious and symptomatic (\eqn{I_s}),
#' infectious asymptomatic (\eqn{I_a}), hospitalised (\eqn{H}), recovered
#' (\eqn{R}), and dead (\eqn{D}).
#'
#' The model currently allows only uniform parameters for transitions between
#' compartments. Group specific parameters are expected to be supported in
#' future.
