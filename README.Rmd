_daedalus_ implements the integrated epidemiological and economic model in @haw2022.

## Installation

You can install the development version of daedalus from [GitHub](https://github.com/) using the _remotes_ package.

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("j-idea/daedalus", upgrade = FALSE)
```

## Quick start

The model can be run for any country or territory in the `country_names` list by passing the country name to the function.
This automatically pulls country-specific demographic and economic data, which is included in the package, into the model (see the ['Get started' vignette](articles/daedalus.html) for more details).

The model runs for 300 timesteps (assumed to be days) by default.

```{r libraries}
library(daedalus)

# run model for Canada
output <- daedalus("Canada")
```

Users can specify pathogen parameter values as well as change the initial conditions by passing arguments to `daedalus()` as `...`.
The function documentation details which parameters are accepted.

```r
# not run
# e.g. change the transmission rate
daedalus("Canada", beta = 1.5 / 7.0) # assume R0 of 1.5, 7 days infectious period

# e.g. change the hospitalisation rate
daedalus("Canada", eta = 1.0 / 1000) # assume 1 in 1000 infectious need hospital
```

Get the data in long or 'tidy' format using `prepare_output()`.

```{r get_data}
data <- prepare_output(output)

head(data)
```
