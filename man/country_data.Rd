\description{
Country-wise data on demography, social contacts, and workforce
participation in economic sectors.
Demography and social contacts are presented in four bins: \verb{[0, 4]},
\verb{[5, 19]}, \verb{[20, 64]}, and \verb{[65, ]}
(combining all individuals aged 65 and higher).
Workforce participation is presented as counts which are assumed to be a
subset of the \verb{[20, 64]} age-bin.

\strong{Note} that some zero values in worker participation data may reflect
missing data for a particular sector.
